# BenOps Ticket Investigation

## Output Language
**Always respond in English**, regardless of the language used in the conversation.

## Overview
Structured investigation workflow for BenOps RPA production failures. Core principle: **Orchestrator logs are ground truth — code analysis without logs first produces wrong root causes.**

## The Iron Rule
**Pull Orchestrator production logs BEFORE reading any process code.**

See `references/investigation-rules.md` for the full red flags and common mistakes list.

## Investigation Order (Non-Negotiable)

### Phase 1 — Orchestrator Production Logs
Pull logs using the Orchestrator REST API. Full query guide, auth instructions, error pattern reference, and tenant IDs: `references/orchestrator-log-queries.md`

**Always run the production connection health check first** (see reference). If the CLI is not on the production tenant, run `uip login` immediately — the browser will open for the user to authenticate. Wait for the user to confirm login is complete before continuing.

**Extract verbatim error messages first.** These drive everything else. Do NOT ask the user to provide logs.

### Phase 2 — Jira Ticket
Pull the ticket via Jira MCP:
- Confirm the exact failure mode described matches the logs
- Check linked tickets — related issues often cover the same process
- Note when failures started — correlates with recent deploys

### Phase 3 — Git History for the Process
```powershell
git log --oneline -- "Processes/.../ProcessName/" | head -20
```
Cross-reference commit dates with when failures started.

### Phase 4 — Recent PRs
Check GitHub PRs merged to `develop` in the last 30–60 days touching the process folder. Dependency bumps and selector changes are the most common regression source.

### Phase 5 — Targeted Code Analysis
**Read ONLY what the logs point to.** The error message and stack trace tell you exactly which file and activity to inspect — do not read the whole process.

### Phase 6 — Fix Proposal
Structure every proposal as:

```markdown
## Root Cause
[Verbatim error from Orchestrator logs]
[File and line where the issue originates]

## Fix
[Specific change — file, activity, selector, or missing file to create]

## Risk
[What breaks if fix is wrong; what other workflows touch this code]

## Test Plan
- [ ] Minimum 3 transactions in Staging Orchestrator
- [ ] Transaction IDs documented
- [ ] No Library files modified (process-level fix only)
```
